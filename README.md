# Weight CLI
*A digital mood ring for your text messages*

Ever wonder if that text you're about to send sounds too intense? Weight helps you check the emotional tone of your messages before hitting send.

Sometimes we write when we're stressed, angry, or overwhelmed - and it shows. This tool gives you a quick emotional temperature check.
